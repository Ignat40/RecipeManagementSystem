# RecipeManagementSystem
Console application that allows users to manage their cooking recipes.

# Task 
Develop a console application that allows users to manage their cooking recipes. The application will enable users to create, view, update, and categorize recipes, as well as search for recipes based on ingredients or categories. The system will also feature category management, enabling users to organize recipes into different categories and manage these categories (create new ones, update or delete existing ones, and reassign recipes to different categories). Recipes must be updated to reflect category changes. If you delete a category, recipes under that category should be put under a “Default” category. Data persistence will be achieved through JSON files, allowing users to maintain their recipe collections across sessions. The project requires collaborative coding using Git and ensures code quality through unit testing with xUnit.
